# Game Centre

## Overview
**Game Centre** is a collection of fun, educational games built using Java and Swing for the GUI. Each game leverages fundamental data structures and algorithms, providing an engaging way to explore and understand programming concepts. 

### Games Included

1. **Guess the Number**:  
   A number guessing game where the player has a limited number of attempts to guess a randomly generated number. This game demonstrates random number generation and basic input handling.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**:  
   The classic two-player game on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces in the grid, aiming to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. This game uses a 2D array for the board and checks for win conditions.

3. **Maze Solver**:  
   A graphical utility that allows users to create a maze and solve it using a chosen algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search). It demonstrates pathfinding and visualizes traversal of data structures.

4. **Sorting Puzzle**:  
   A puzzle game where players arrange elements in the correct order through drag-and-drop. This game illustrates sorting concepts in a hands-on format.

5. **Memory Matching**:  
   A card memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. This game focuses on array manipulation, randomness for shuffling, and memory concepts.

6. **Tower of Hanoi**:  
   A classic puzzle that demonstrates recursive algorithms. Players must move a set of disks from one tower to another following specific rules, with recursive logic used to manage the sequence of moves.

7. **Hangman**:  
   A word-guessing game where players attempt to reveal a hidden word by guessing letters. It showcases string manipulation, array tracking of guessed letters, and condition checking for win/loss.

8. **Puzzle Slider**:  
   A sliding puzzle game (typically 3x3 or 4x4) where players move tiles into the correct numerical order. This game utilizes 2D arrays and random shuffling, as well as logic for checking win conditions.

9. **Sudoku**:  
   The classic number-placement puzzle on a 9x9 grid. Players input numbers and can check if they have completed the puzzle correctly. This game demonstrates validation of row, column, and subgrid rules.
