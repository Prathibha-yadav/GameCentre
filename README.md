# Game Centre

## Overview
**Game Centre** is a collection of interactive games developed in Java using the Swing framework for a graphical user interface (GUI). The application provides a fun and engaging way to explore various programming concepts and algorithms through gameplay.

### Games Included

1. **Guess the Number**:  
   A number guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides hints indicating whether the guess should be higher or lower.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Random number generation, conditional statements.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**:  
   A classic two-player game where players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
   - **DSA Concepts**: 2D arrays, win condition checks.

3. **Maze Solver**:  
   A graphical maze-solving game where players navigate through a maze using arrow keys, aiming to reach the bottom right corner.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Graph traversal algorithm (Depth-First Search).

4. **Sorting Puzzle**:  
   Players enter a series of numbers and select a sorting algorithm to sort them. This game helps visualize how different sorting algorithms work.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort).

5. **Memory Matching**:  
   A memory game where players must match pairs of numbers by clicking on them. It tests and improves memory and recall skills.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Arrays for card storage and tracking state.

6. **Tower of Hanoi**:  
   A classic puzzle game where players enter the number of disks and receive the steps required to solve the puzzle using recursive logic.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Recursion and algorithm efficiency.

7. **Hangman**:  
   A word-guessing game where players have a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Strings for word management, arrays for tracking guessed letters.

8. **Puzzle Slider**:  
   A sliding puzzle game where players must arrange numbered tiles in increasing order by sliding them into the empty space.
   - **DSA Concepts**: 2D arrays for the board state, logic for movement and win conditions.

9. **Sudoku**:  
   A number-placement puzzle where players fill a 9x9 grid with numbers, ensuring that each number appears only once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
   - **DSA Concepts**: Backtracking algorithms for validation and solution checking.

## How to Run
